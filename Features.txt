Got it 👍 — here’s your **fully updated feature list** with all the requested modifications applied carefully and consistently:

---

## ⚙️ **Updated Smart Wheelchair Features (Latest Version)**

---

### 🎮 **Core Motion Control (Joystick-Based)**

* **Hand gesture control removed.**
* Wheelchair is now **controlled via a joystick** for direction (forward, backward, left, right).
* **Speed control** is now managed by **joystick angle** — the more the joy stick is tilted forward or in the respective direction, the faster the wheelchair moves. 
* Joystick data is transmitted **wirelessly via ESP module** (replacing NRF24L01+).
* Smooth acceleration and deceleration based on tilt intensity.
* Chair IMU monitors slope/tilt — if too steep or unstable, wheelchair stops and sends SOS alert.
* Smart stop remains active: wheelchair automatically halts if obstacle/person detected.
* Ignore/enable button on joystick module to temporarily disable control input.

### 🧠 **AI + Vision System (Raspberry Pi + Pi Camera V2 + ESP32-S3 Integration)**

* Raspberry Pi handles **AI reasoning, scene understanding, and advanced perception**.
* **Pi Camera V2** provides higher-quality image input for AI-based vision.
* Functions include:

  * Object and person detection.
  * Door and path recognition (detects color, size, and opening direction).
  * Smart pathfinding and obstacle avoidance.
  * Scene understanding (“Two people ahead, door to the right”).
  * Real-time smart stop when obstacle/person detected.
  * Small-turn and path correction (ADAS-like control).
  * Visual lane keeping and target tracking.
  * AI-driven navigation toward visually detected goals (“brown door,” “small gate”).
* AI integrated with **ChatGPT** for reasoning and natural conversation.
* Understands natural commands like:

  * “Move toward the brown door.”
  * “Turn left after the red wall.”
  * “Go straight until the open space.”
* AI can also respond to queries:

  * “What’s the time?”
  * “Who is in front of me?”
  * “Where am I right now?”
  * “What is 45 × 17?”
* AI provides **voice feedback** for alerts, directions, and responses.
* Wake-word detection (“PorQ”) to activate voice mode.
* Offline fallback for limited local commands when Wi-Fi unavailable.

### 📡 **Connectivity & Communication**

* **ESP modules (ESP32-S3 and ESP8266/ESP32)** replace NRF24L01+ for wireless communication.
* ESP provides robust **Wi-Fi and Bluetooth** connectivity between joystick controller, main board, and AI system.
* **Bluetooth connection** (via mobile/laptop GUI) for:

  * Settings updates (speed, geofence, reminders).
  * Status checks (“Battery level?”, “Connection OK?”).
  * Live control tests.
* **Wi-Fi connection** to cloud (ChatGPT) for intelligent conversation and AI reasoning.

### 🚨 **Safety, SOS, and Alerts**

* Dedicated **SOS button** on wheelchair triggers:

  * Motor cutoff.
  * Loud buzzer alert.
  * SOS SMS with live GPS location to caretaker.
* **Voice-triggered SOS** (“PorQ help me”).
* **Automatic SOS** if wheelchair tilts dangerously or detects impact.
* **Failsafe stop** if joystick or AI connection is lost.
* **Emergency power-off button** for full system shutdown.
* **Smart stop** still active — AI automatically stops when obstacle/person detected.
* Visual or buzzer alerts (no haptic feedback).

---

### 🌍 **GPS Tracking & Geofencing**

* **NEO-6M GPS module** for precise tracking.
* **Geofencing system**:

  * Configurable safe zone radius.
  * Sends SMS alert with coordinates when leaving the area.
* **Periodic live location updates** via SMS.
* Automatic location report in SOS or low-battery condition.
* Caretaker can request live location anytime.

---

### 💊 **Medicine Reminder & AI Health Assistance**

* **DS3231 RTC** ensures accurate real-time clock.
* AI-based medicine reminders:

  * Voice alert via speaker:
    “It’s time for your medicine — the red tablet in the small box.”
  * Configurable reminder schedule via Bluetooth GUI.
* Buzzer alerts user when reminder is due.
* AI repeats reminder until user acknowledges via button or voice command.

---

### 🔊 **Audio Interaction**

* **I²S microphone** for wake-word and command input.
* **Speaker + amplifier** for AI voice output.
* **Buzzer** used for all system alerts and medicine reminders.
* Clear voice feedback for all interactions (movement, warnings, reminders).

---

### 🕹️ **Joystick Control Unit**

* Compact hand-held joystick replaces glove.
* 2-axis analog joystick controls direction.
* Tilt sensors in seat control speed intensity.
* **ESP module** in joystick sends data to main controller wirelessly.
* “Ignore” button to disable control input temporarily.
* Rechargeable via TP4056 module.

---

### 🪫 **Power & Hardware Management**

* Central **main power switch** for entire system.
* Battery voltage monitoring (low battery triggers SMS + buzzer).
* Power relay disconnects motors during SOS, stop, or sleep mode.
* Isolated logic (5V) and motor (12–24V) supplies.
* Overcurrent and fuse protection.
* Power-efficient standby mode — only AI listener active.

---

### 💡 **Advanced AI Safety & Navigation**

* Smart stop for obstacle and human detection.
* Self-correcting movement using AI vision.
* Scene-based AI navigation (targets like doors, corridors).
* AI integrates camera + sensor data for safer movement.
* Context-aware reasoning:

  * “Avoid that chair.”
  * “The door is closed.”
  * “Safe path on the left.”
* ChatGPT reasoning via Wi-Fi for contextual dialogue.
* Local fallback if Wi-Fi fails (basic motion + SOS + GPS).
* Automated health, system, and location status reporting.
